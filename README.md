## Overview

- **Project Name**: Bitcoin Price Prediction with LSTM
- **Author**: lavender echessa
- **Date**: 12/10/2023
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/lavEche

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to forecast Bitcoin prices  September and October 2023) using LSTM,
## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: The project involves data cleaning, normalization, and slicing the data into training and test sets. Proper data preprocessing is essential to ensure accurate model training.

- **LSTM Model**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed to capture temporal dependencies in the Bitcoin price data. The architecture of the LSTM model is designed to optimize prediction accuracy.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search and random search, are employed to fine-tune the model for better performance.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: The project uses various evaluation metrics, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), to assess the model's accuracy and predictive power.

- **Model Visualization**: Visualizations are included to illustrate the model's performance on the training and test data, aiding in a comprehensive understanding of the results.
